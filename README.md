# Algorithms & Data Structure

## What is It?

This is my study plan for algorithms and data structure. Codes are written with C++(C++17) and Python(3.6).

I study with the following book.

- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)

- [Python Algorithm Interview, 파이썬 알고리즘 인터뷰](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=9791189909178&orderClick=4bb)
